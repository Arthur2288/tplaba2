At the beginning of 1806, Nikolai Rostov returned on vacation. Denisov was also on his way home to Voronezh, and Rostov persuaded him to go with him to Moscow and stay at their house. At the penultimate station, meeting a comrade, Denisov drank three bottles of wine with him and, approaching Moscow, despite the bumps in the road, did not wake up, lying at the bottom of a sledge, next to Rostov, who, as he approached Moscow, became more and more impatient.
"Will it be soon? Will it be soon? Oh, those obnoxious streets, shops, rolls, lanterns, cabs!" thought Rostov, when they had already recorded their vacations at the outpost and entered Moscow.
- Denisov, we've arrived! Sleeping! - he said, leaning forward with his whole body, as if by this position he hoped to accelerate the movement of the sledge. Denisov did not respond.
- Here is the corner-intersection where Zakhar the cabman stands; here he is Zakhar, and still the same horse. Here is the shop where they bought gingerbread. Will it be soon? Well!
- to what house?  The driver asked.
